# Tweet Classification Project on Covid19 tweets

This was a school project regarding classification of tweets per sentiment about Covid19.
Models used include SVMs, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forests.

To complete this project, I used a variety of packages often used in machine learning and data analysis mainly:
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) Matplotlib
4) ScikitLearn
